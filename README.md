## How to use Q1.ipynb
Step 1) Import the necessary libraries by running the first two code cells.
Step 2) To get the number of entries for each label, run Cell 3. Cell 4 will print the content of the 
        dictionaries for both the emotions labels and the sentiments labels, with the number of entries assigned to each
Step 3) This is to create the figures for the label distribution:
      3.1) To get the histogram for the sentiments distributions, run the Cell 5. This will also save the figure as png in the same folder as Q1.inpynb.
      3.2) To get the pie chart for the emotions distributions, run the Cell 6. This will also save the figure as png in the same folder as Q1.inpynb
